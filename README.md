# Final project: Building Facebook

This is Microverse's final project in Ruby on Rail's course. In this project, we build a social media page similar to [Facebook][facebook] where the users can create and edit an account, add other users as friends, post their thoughts, comment and like their friends and their own posts.

## Link to assignment

The assignment for this project is in the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course that can be found [here][assignment].

This project was divided into 8 milestones:

* First: Preparation for the data architecture and documentation where the project as planned and an Entity Relationship Diagram was created.
* Second: Project setup as described in Odin Project.
* Third: Created the models with associations for users, posts, and likes in posts.
* Fourth: Created the model with the association for comments and likes in comments.
* Fifth: Started to implement friendship, allowing users to request, accept, reject and undo friendship with other users.
* Sixth: We implemented friendship with 2 rows for mutual friendship as described [here][friendship]
* Seventh: Login with a Facebook account using omniauth.
* Eighth: Deploy for Heroku

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) describes illustratively how the associations work in this project. Our final version can be seen below:
